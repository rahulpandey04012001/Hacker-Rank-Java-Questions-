### Hackerrank JAVA Solution-

Hello fellow contributers,
I'm Rahul Pandey and I decided to practice JAVA from the Hackerrank platform. For good practice I decided to upload my solutions on Github so that 'YOU' can watch it and improve me by createing a pull request. By doing this, We both get benefitted from this. 
## Together we can improve both of us. 

## All your suggestions are heartily welcome.
